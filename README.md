This project features a **Gemini API-based chatbot**, powered by **Python Flask** for the backend and **React.js** for the frontend. It stores chat history in a **MySQL database** and uses the **Gemini LLM model** to generate responses based on user queries. The chatbot fetches and summarizes relevant data about products, suppliers, and other details, offering dynamic and real-time interactions. Users can easily access past chats for a seamless conversation experience, making it a powerful tool for retrieving and summarizing data in an interactive way.
